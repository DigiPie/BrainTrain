By: `Team BrainTrain`      Since: `Jan 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your app works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the app. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

* `Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`] which is responsible for:

** Initializing the components in the correct sequence and connecting them at app launch.
** Shutting down the components and invoking necessary clean-up methods at app closure.

* <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> is a collection of classes which provides useful utility methods used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

** `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the app's log file.
* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Handles the user interface.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes commands.
* <<Design-ManagementModel,*`ManagementModel`*>>: Handles the in-memory data of management mode.
* <<Design-QuizModel,*`QuizModel`*>>: Handles the in-memory data of quiz mode.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads and writes data to the hard disk.

The <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>, <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>, <<Design-ManagementModel,*`ManagementModel`*>>, <<Design-QuizModel,*`QuizModel`*>> and <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>> components have the following structure:

* Has an API in the form of an Java interface named after the component.
* Has its functionality exposed through a Java class named `{Component Name}Manager`.

For example, the `Logic` component (refer to class diagram below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`, interface and exposes its functionality through the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses either the `ManagementModeParser` or `QuizModeParser` class to parse the user command.
..  If `ManagementParser` is used to parse the user command:
...  This results in a `ManagementCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
...  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
..  If `QuizModeParser` is used to parse the user command:
...  This results in a `QuizCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
...  The command execution can affect the `QuizModel` (e.g. answering a question).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-ManagementModel]]
=== ManagementModel component

.Structure of the ManagementModel Component
image::ManagementModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/modelmanager/ManagementModel.java[`ManagementModel.java`]

The `ManagementModel`,

* stores a `UserPref` object which represents the user's preferences.
* stores the in-memory lessons in `LessonList`.
* depends on none of the other components.

[[Design-QuizModel]]
=== QuizModel component

.Structure of the QuizModel Component
image::QuizModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/modelmanager/QuizModel.java[`QuizModel.java`]

The `QuizModel`,

* stores a `Quiz` object that represents a list of `QuizCard`.
* stores a `Session` object that represents a list of `SrsCard`.
* stores a `ManagementModelManager` object that represents the `ManagementModel` component.
* depends on only the `ManagementModel` component.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save user preferences in json format and read it back.
* can save lesson data in csv format and read it back.
* can save the user's SRS data in csv format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::datastorage[]
=== Data storage feature
The data storage feature manages the saving of data, such as lessons and user progress, to disk for the application. This lets the user keep their progress between usage sessions.

==== Current Implementation
All data storage components implement public functions that are called through Storage, with no user commands currently implemented. These functions include saving and reading of files, with an option for changing the default directory where each kind of data is saved.

NOTE: These functions are automatically performed on opening/closing the Session.

==== Design Considerations
* ** Alternative 1(Current choice): Automate importing/exporting when session is open/close
** Pros: Lesser commands to manage.
** Cons: Opening and closing may take up a lot of time if file is very big.

* **Alternative 2: Individual commands for user to toggle with to import and export files when desired
** Pros: More control given to user
** Cons: Accidental overwriting of files may occur.
// end::datastorage[]


// tag::csvstorage[]
=== CSV storage feature
==== Current Implementation
The lesson CSV storage feature implements the following functions:

* Parsing lesson data into the correct format for saving
* Parsing data from file into lessons

Actual file I/O is handled in the CsvUtil class, which uses the opencsv library to read/write CSV files.

==== CSV Format
.Data flow diagram for Lessons saving
image::CsvStorageDiagram.png[width="800"]

Lessons are parsed by CsvLessonListStorage, being converted between Lesson and List<String[]> formats. The List<String[]> format is the primary format handled by CsvUtil for reading and writing to CSV files.

For lessons, there are three main components when saved to a CSV file.

===== Name
Lesson names are equivalent to their filenames.

A lesson named "French" would be saved as French.csv, and vice-versa.

===== Header
The header stores the set up information for the lesson. For more information on the format of lessons, please read `TODO`

Core fields start with `CORE_ESCAPE` character, `\*`. When a field without `*` is found, all subsequent fields are assumed to be optional.

Question and answer fields have the `QUESTION_ESCAPE` character, `?`, and `ANSWER_ESCAPE` character, `@`, respectively after the core character, `*`.

===== Card Data

All remaining data is treated as card data. Any invalid data found in memory or from the file is skipped over.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Choice of file type
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save as CSV
** Pros: Allows the user to edit lesson data in an external program such as Excel, which provides a user-friendly spreadsheet interface.
** Cons: Lack of data verification within the file, JSON already implemented
* **Alternative 2:** Save as JSON
** Pros: Can ensure all values are filled out correctly
** Cons: Difficult for user to edit

// end::csvstorage[]


// tag::session[]
=== Session feature
Session feature generates cards for users in quiz session based on their requirement.

==== Current Implementation
The session feature implements the following functions:

* Combining data from lesson and user together.
* Generating a list of cards for quiz based on SRS(Space-Repetition technique) method and updating user data after quiz ends.

==== SRS method
The SRS method allows users to be tested with the most urgent questions. The method gives each card a `srsDueDate` field which contains
an instant value representing the deadline of testing this card again.

The SRS method updates users profile using link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system[Leitner_system].

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: SRS method for updating
* **Alternative 1: Leinter System (current choice)**
** Pros: Efficient in calculation and easy to understand.
** Cons: The time interval between levels cannot be long.
* **Alternative 2: Pimsleur's graduated-interval recall**
** Pros: Short times interval between the first few repetitions.
** Cons: No level attribute to value the element clearly.
* Alternative 1 was chosen because it clearly displays the due date in several levels.

//end::session[]



// tag::quiz[]
=== Quiz feature
Quiz feature allows users to enter quiz related commands and answer.

==== Current Implementation
The quiz feature processes the following inputs:

* `[ANSWER]...` - An input without a prefix `\` is treated as an answer.
* `\difficult` - Labels current question in quiz as difficult or not.
* `\help` - Lists all commands in quiz and inputs the program will accept.
* `\hint` - Reveals additional information to help user to solve the question.
* `\quit` - Quits a quiz and save attempted progress.
* `\status` - Lists current status and lesson progress of user.

==== Quiz class

link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/quiz/Quiz.java[`Quiz.java`] holds all the
information of quiz in memory. It takes in a list of <<card,cards>> from `Session` and generate a
new list of cards based on the `mode` indicated by the user. The generated list of cards in both
`review` and `learn` mode includes questions and answers that are flipped to ensure that user are
learning both the values. Accordingly to the mode that the user have chosen, the cards will be
displayed differently.

In the four different modes:

* **Preview**: both the question and answer are shown to the user

.Display for previewing a question.
image::quiz-command-examples/quiz-preview.PNG[width="300"]

* **Review**: only the question is shown as the user needs to answer the question.

.Display for reviewing a question.
image::quiz-command-examples/quiz-review.PNG[width="300"]

* **Learn**: is a combination of preview and review, which the user see both the question and
answer before attempting the question.

.Display for learning a question.
image::quiz-command-examples/quiz-learn.PNG[width="670"]

* **Difficult**: similar to preview mode but only contains questions that have been labelled as
difficult.

The following code shows how are the cards generated:
[source,java]
----
private List<QuizCard> generate() {
    generatedQuizCardList = new ArrayList<>();

    switch (mode) {
    case PREVIEW:
        generatePreview();
        break;
    case LEARN:
        // Learn is a combination of preview + review
        generatePreview();
        generateReview();
        break;
    case REVIEW:
        generateReview();
        break;
    case DIFFICULT:
        generatePreview();
        break;
    default:
        break;
    }

    generatedCardSize = generatedQuizCardList.size();
    return generatedQuizCardList;
}

private void generateReview() {
    QuizCard currentCard;
    for (int i = 0; i < originalQuizCardList.size(); i++) {
        currentCard = originalQuizCardList.get(i);
        generatedQuizCardList.add(
            currentCard.generateOrderedQuizCardWithIndex(i, QuizMode.REVIEW));
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < originalQuizCardList.size(); i++) {
        currentCard = originalQuizCardList.get(i);
        generatedQuizCardList.add(
            currentCard.generateFlippedQuizCardWithIndex(i));
    }
}

private void generatePreview() {
    QuizCard currentCard;

    for (int i = 0; i < originalQuizCardList.size(); i++) {
        currentCard = originalQuizCardList.get(i);
        generatedQuizCardList.add(
            currentCard.generateOrderedQuizCardWithIndex(i, QuizMode.PREVIEW));
    }
}
----

==== [ANSWER]
The `[ANSWER]` feature is facilitated by `QuizAnswerCommand`. The command takes in user input
as answer to be processed later.

The following sequence diagram shows the interaction between the various classes when the user
answered the question correctly:

.Sequence diagram for answer feature
image::QuizAnswerCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]

In the `execute` method of the `QuizAnswerCommand`, the following steps could be performed:

1. Quiz result +
This step checks if the user is shown the result, this is performed as quiz can only ends after
the result has been shown before. Once the quiz ends, BrainTrain will save the progress of the quiz
to the file specified by the user.

2. Handling of answer +
This step checks if the answer should be handled, if user is in `PREVIEW` mode it will not be
handled. Otherwise, the total attempts and streak of the question will be updated accordingly to
if the question has been answered correctly.

3. Handling of next question +
This step verifies the question has been answered correct and checks if there are still questions
left in the quiz, either gets the next question or show the quiz result to the user.

The following code shows how the steps could be performed:

[source,java]
----
public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
    requireNonNull(model);
    this.quizModel = requireQuizModel(model);
    this.card = quizModel.getCurrentQuizCard();
    this.isCurrentCardWrong = false;

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

    if (quizModel.isResultDisplay()) {
        endQuiz();
        return new CommandResult("", true, false, false);
    }

    if (card.isWrongTwice() || card.getQuizMode() != QuizMode.PREVIEW) {
        sb.append(handleCurrentCardAnswer());
    }

    if (!isCurrentCardWrong) {
        String result = handleIfCardLeft();
        sb.append(result);
    }

    return new CommandResult(sb.toString(), true, false, false);
}

----

==== \quit
The `\quit` will force quit the current quiz and save the attempted question to the location that
the user have specified in `UserPref`, by default it will saved to `\data\user\savedata.csv`. Once
the `\quit` command have succeeded running, it will return back to the `ManagementMode`.

.Sequence diagram for quit feature
image::QuizQuitCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== \status
The `\status` feature lists the total number of attempts you have attempted, total number of
question you have gotten correct in this quiz and which question you are currently on.

.Sequence diagram for status feature
image::QuizStatusCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Quiz and management commands execution
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Run quiz in a different mode
** Pros: Least restricted choice of answer and great user experience.
** Cons: Tedious to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Run quiz together with the rest of the commands
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Restricted answer and compromised user experience. Answer cannot start with words already
listed as management commands
(e.g. `start`)

**Alternative 1** is chosen because it allows the user to have a more comprehensive choice of
word as answer without restricting the possible choices. In certain question, it is possible for the
answer to be "start". Hence by choosing alternative 1, the choice of answer is the least
restricted. Also, by running the quiz in a different mode, it allows the user to have intuitive
interaction in quiz mode.
// end::quiz[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the app
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide documentation settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file documentation settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire app by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev ops

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested programming tasks to get started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `ManagementModel` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `managementModel`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular `core` from the opened lesson's headers and also from all its cards, but the `managementModel` API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-ManagementModel>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

Add a `removeCoreFromlesson(String core)` method. The specified core will be removed from the opened lesson's headers and from all its cards.
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/modelmanager/ManagementModel.java[ManagementModel], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/lesson/LessonList.java[LessonList] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/lesson/Lesson.java[Lesson] need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting cores?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/lesson/LessonList.java[LessonList] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/lesson/Lesson.java[Lesson] classes can be used to implement the core removal logic.
* Suggested solution
** Implement a `removeCoreFromlesson(String core)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/managementModel/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new method `removeCoreFromlesson(String core)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/lesson/LessonList.java[LessonList]. Your {repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/modelmanager/ManagementModel.java[ManagementModel] should call `Lessonlist#removeCoreFromlesson(String core)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAddressBookStorage.java[`JsonAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/managementModel/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to managementModel component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/managementModel/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/managementModel/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/managementModel/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/managementModel/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `data/addressbook.json` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `JsonAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedPerson.java[`JsonAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.json`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.json`, `validAddressBook.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/managementModel/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
