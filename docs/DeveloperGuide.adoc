By: `Team BrainTrain`      Since: `Jan 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your app works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the app. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

* `Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`] which is responsible for:

** Initializing the components in the correct sequence and connecting them at app launch.
** Shutting down the components and invoking necessary clean-up methods at app closure.

* <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> is a collection of classes which provides useful utility methods used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

** `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the app's log file.
* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Handles the user interface.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes commands.
* <<Design-ManagementModel,*`ManagementModel`*>>: Handles the in-memory data of management mode.
* <<Design-QuizModel,*`QuizModel`*>>: Handles the in-memory data of quiz mode.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads and writes data to the hard disk.

The <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>, <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>, <<Design-ManagementModel,*`ManagementModel`*>>, <<Design-QuizModel,*`QuizModel`*>> and <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>> components have the following structure:

* Has an API in the form of an Java interface named after the component.
* Has its functionality exposed through a Java class named `{Component Name}Manager`.

For example, the `Logic` component (refer to class diagram below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`, interface and exposes its functionality through the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses either the `ManagementModeParser` or `QuizModeParser` class to parse the user command.
..  If `ManagementParser` is used to parse the user command:
...  This results in a `ManagementCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
...  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
..  If `QuizModeParser` is used to parse the user command:
...  This results in a `QuizCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
...  The command execution can affect the `QuizModel` (e.g. answering a question).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-ManagementModel]]
=== ManagementModel component

.Structure of the ManagementModel Component
image::ManagementModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/modelmanager/ManagementModel.java[`ManagementModel.java`]

The `ManagementModel`,

* stores a `UserPref` object which represents the user's preferences.
* stores the in-memory lessons in `LessonList`.
* depends on none of the other components.

[[Design-QuizModel]]
=== QuizModel component

.Structure of the QuizModel Component
image::QuizModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/modelmanager/QuizModel.java[`QuizModel.java`]

The `QuizModel`,

* stores a `Quiz` object that represents a list of `QuizCard`.
* stores a `Session` object that represents a list of `SrsCard`.
* stores a `ManagementModelManager` object that represents the `ManagementModel` component.
* depends on only the `ManagementModel` component.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save user preferences in json format and read it back.
* can save lesson data in csv format and read it back.
* can save the user's SRS data in csv format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::datastorage[]
=== Data storage feature
==== Current Implementation
The data CSV Storage features implements the following functions:

* Parsing user data into the correct format for file saving
* Parsing file into the correct format for user data

NOTE: These functions are automatically performed on opening/closing the application. File I/O is handled in CSVUtil class

==== Csv User Format
.Data flow diagram for User saving
image::CsvUserStorage.png[width="800"]

The user is parsed by CsvUserStorage, which is converted between User and List<String[]> format. List<String[]> format
is the primary format handled by CsvUtil for reading and writing to CSV files.

A few noteworthy main components saved into a CSV file for UserStorage are listed below.

==== Hashcode
This is the question hashcode. Every question will have a unique hashcode.

==== SRSDueDate
This is the srsDueDate for each question. The questions with a nearer due-date will be generated first in the quiz.

==== Difficult
These are questions that are labelled difficult by the user.

==== Design Considerations
* ** Alternative 1(Current choice):** Automate importing/exporting when session is open/close
** Pros: Lesser commands to manage.
** Cons: Opening and closing may take up a lot of time if file is very big.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual commands for user to toggle with to import and export files when desired
** Pros: More control given to user
** Cons: Accidental overwriting of files may occur.
// end::datastorage[]


// tag::csvstorage[]
=== CSV lesson storage feature
==== Current Implementation
The lesson CSV storage feature implements the following functions:

* Parsing lesson data into a list of string arrays, which is a format OpenCSV accepts for saving to CSV.
* Parsing a list of string arrays back into lesson data, as retrieved from opencsv.

Actual file I/O is handled in the CsvUtil class, which uses the opencsv library to read/write CSV files.

==== CSV Lesson Format
.High-level sequence diagram for the `reloadLessons` command, an example of lesson loading
image::CsvLessonStorageSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Lessons are parsed by CsvLessonListStorage, being converted between Lesson and List<String[]> formats. The List<String[]> format is the primary format handled by CsvUtil for reading and writing to CSV files.

For lessons, there are three main sections when saved to a CSV file.

===== Name
A lesson's name in BrainTrain is equivalent to its file name.

A lesson named "French" would be saved as French.csv, and vice-versa.

===== Header
The header is represented in the file as the first two lines. Each line represents a specific set of data, as outlined below.

The first line represents the type of the corresponding column. Each column can have three types:

. *Tested* +
This marks the column as a core value. The first two instances of *Tested* in the file will be used in quizzes, and all remaining Tested values are treated as *Not Tested*.
. *Not Tested* +
This marks the column as a core value. However, unlike *Tested*, they will not be tested in quizzes, but can be chosen to be tested.
. *Hint* +
The values here will appear when the user uses the hint command during the quiz. However, values here are strictly optional, and can be left empty.

NOTE: Core values require every value in that column to be non-empty. This guarantees that the user will be tested on something should they change which fields are tested.

This is a code snippet from the parsing of the header data.

    for (int i = 0; i < headerArray.length; i++) {
        if (headerArray[i].isEmpty()) {
            headerArray[i] = " ";
        }
    }
    int coreCount = 0;
    int index = 0;
    while (index < headerArray.length) {
        String headerChar = headerArray[index].toLowerCase().substring(0, 1);
        if (headerChar.equals(HEADER_CORE_QA)) {
            if (questionIndex == -1) {
                questionIndex = index;
            } else if (answerIndex == -1) {
                answerIndex = index;
            }
            coreCount++;
        } else if (headerChar.equals(HEADER_CORE_NOT_QA)) {
            coreCount++;
        } else if (!headerChar.equals(HEADER_OPTIONAL)) {
            return returnValues;
        }
        index++;
    }

As seen at the beginning of the while loop, header values are actually treated as single case-insensitive characters. This means an experienced user may simply enter those letters as a shortcut.

{empty} +

The second line represents the name of each column as shown to the user. Any names left blank are automatically replaced with Unnamed.

Any discrepancies in the number of types and the number of names will result in the lesson not being loaded.

===== Card Data

All remaining data is treated as card data. Any invalid data found in memory or from the file is skipped over.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Choice of file type
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save as CSV
** Pros: User is able to modify lesson data in a more advanced external spreadsheet tool like Excel
** Cons: Lack of data verification within the file, JSON is already implemented in original code
* **Alternative 2:** Save as JSON
** Pros: All values can be verified through the file
** Cons: Difficult for user to edit manually

Alternative 1 was chosen as ease of use is a high priority for the project. Most computer users are familiar with the Microsoft Office suite of applications, such as Word and Excel. As Excel allows CSV files to be shown in a spreadsheet, it was intended that users use Excel alongside BrainTrain for easy lesson management.

===== Aspect: Handling of invalid data
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Skip over specific lesson/card
** Pros: User data is not automatically overwritten
** Cons: User has to manually fix any issues with their data
* **Alternative 2:** Automatically fix data
** Pros: Ease of use for user
** Cons: Automatic fix may not be as desired by user

Alternative 1 was chosen as creators are expected to have some skill in data editing. Normal users would ideally only download lessons from a creator, and would not be familiar enough with the lesson data to fix any issues.
// end::csvstorage[]


// tag::session[]
=== Session feature
Session feature generates cards for users in quiz session based on their requirement.

==== Current Implementation
The session feature implements the following functions:

* Combining data from lesson and user together.
* Generating a list of cards for quiz based on SRS(Space-Repetition technique) method and updating user data after quiz ends.

==== SRS method
The SRS method allows users to be tested with the most urgent questions. The method gives each card a `srsDueDate` field which contains
an instant value representing the deadline of testing this card again.

The SRS method updates users profile using link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system[Leitner_system].

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: SRS method for updating
* **Alternative 1: Leinter System (current choice)**
** Pros: Efficient in calculation and easy to understand.
** Cons: The time interval between levels cannot be long.
* **Alternative 2: Pimsleur's graduated-interval recall**
** Pros: Short times interval between the first few repetitions.
** Cons: No level attribute to value the element clearly.
* Alternative 1 was chosen because it clearly displays the due date in several levels.

//end::session[]



// tag::quiz[]
=== Quiz feature
Quiz feature allows users to enter quiz related commands and answer.

==== Current Implementation
The quiz feature processes the following inputs:

* `[ANSWER]...` - An input without a prefix `\` is treated as an answer.
* `\difficult` - Labels current question in quiz as difficult or not.
* `\help` - Lists all commands in quiz and inputs the program will accept.
* `\hint` - Reveals additional information to help user to solve the question.
* `\quit` - Quits a quiz and save attempted progress.
* `\status` - Lists current status and lesson progress of user.

==== Quiz class

link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/quiz/Quiz.java[`Quiz.java`] holds all the
information of quiz in memory. It takes in a list of <<card,cards>> from `Session` and generate a
new list of cards based on the `mode` indicated by the user. The generated list of cards in both
`review` and `learn` mode includes questions and answers that are flipped to ensure that user are
learning both the values. Accordingly to the mode that the user have chosen, the cards will be
displayed differently.

In the four different modes:

* **Preview**: both the question and answer are shown to the user

.Display for previewing a question.
image::quiz-command-examples/quiz-preview.PNG[width="300"]

* **Review**: only the question is shown as the user needs to answer the question.

.Display for reviewing a question.
image::quiz-command-examples/quiz-review.PNG[width="300"]

* **Learn**: is a combination of preview and review, which the user see both the question and
answer before attempting the question.

.Display for learning a question.
image::quiz-command-examples/quiz-learn.PNG[width="670"]

* **Difficult**: similar to preview mode but only contains questions that have been labelled as
difficult.

The following code shows how are the cards generated:
[source,java]
----
private List<QuizCard> generate() {
    generatedQuizCardList = new ArrayList<>();

    switch (mode) {
    case PREVIEW:
        generatePreview();
        break;
    case LEARN:
        // Learn is a combination of preview + review
        generatePreview();
        generateReview();
        break;
    case REVIEW:
        generateReview();
        break;
    case DIFFICULT:
        generatePreview();
        break;
    default:
        break;
    }

    generatedCardSize = generatedQuizCardList.size();
    return generatedQuizCardList;
}

private void generateReview() {
    QuizCard currentCard;
    for (int i = 0; i < originalQuizCardList.size(); i++) {
        currentCard = originalQuizCardList.get(i);
        generatedQuizCardList.add(
            currentCard.generateOrderedQuizCardWithIndex(i, QuizMode.REVIEW));
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < originalQuizCardList.size(); i++) {
        currentCard = originalQuizCardList.get(i);
        generatedQuizCardList.add(
            currentCard.generateFlippedQuizCardWithIndex(i));
    }
}

private void generatePreview() {
    QuizCard currentCard;

    for (int i = 0; i < originalQuizCardList.size(); i++) {
        currentCard = originalQuizCardList.get(i);
        generatedQuizCardList.add(
            currentCard.generateOrderedQuizCardWithIndex(i, QuizMode.PREVIEW));
    }
}
----

==== [ANSWER]
The `[ANSWER]` feature is facilitated by `QuizAnswerCommand`. The command takes in user input
as answer to be processed later.

The following sequence diagram shows the interaction between the various classes when the user
answered the question correctly:

.Sequence diagram for answer feature
image::QuizAnswerCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]

In the `execute` method of the `QuizAnswerCommand`, the following steps could be performed:

1. Quiz result +
This step checks if the user is shown the result, this is performed as quiz can only ends after
the result has been shown before. Once the quiz ends, BrainTrain will save the progress of the quiz
to the file specified by the user.

2. Handling of answer +
This step checks if the answer should be handled, if user is in `PREVIEW` mode it will not be
handled. Otherwise, the total attempts and streak of the question will be updated accordingly to
if the question has been answered correctly.

3. Handling of next question +
This step verifies the question has been answered correct and checks if there are still questions
left in the quiz, either gets the next question or show the quiz result to the user.

The following code shows how the steps could be performed:

[source,java]
----
public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
    requireNonNull(model);
    this.quizModel = requireQuizModel(model);
    this.card = quizModel.getCurrentQuizCard();
    this.isCurrentCardWrong = false;

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

    if (quizModel.isResultDisplay()) {
        endQuiz();
        return new CommandResult("", true, false, false);
    }

    if (card.isWrongTwice() || card.getQuizMode() != QuizMode.PREVIEW) {
        sb.append(handleCurrentCardAnswer());
    }

    if (!isCurrentCardWrong) {
        String result = handleIfCardLeft();
        sb.append(result);
    }

    return new CommandResult(sb.toString(), true, false, false);
}

----

==== \quit
The `\quit` will force quit the current quiz and save the attempted question to the location that
the user have specified in `UserPref`, by default it will saved to `\data\user\savedata.csv`. Once
the `\quit` command have succeeded running, it will return back to the `ManagementMode`.

.Sequence diagram for quit feature
image::QuizQuitCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== \status
The `\status` feature lists the total number of attempts you have attempted, total number of
question you have gotten correct in this quiz and which question you are currently on.

.Sequence diagram for status feature
image::QuizStatusCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Quiz and management commands execution
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Run quiz in a different mode
** Pros: Least restricted choice of answer and great user experience.
** Cons: Tedious to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Run quiz together with the rest of the commands
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Restricted answer and compromised user experience. Answer cannot start with words already
listed as management commands
(e.g. `start`)

**Alternative 1** is chosen because it allows the user to have a more comprehensive choice of
word as answer without restricting the possible choices. In certain question, it is possible for the
answer to be "start". Hence by choosing alternative 1, the choice of answer is the least
restricted. Also, by running the quiz in a different mode, it allows the user to have intuitive
interaction in quiz mode.
// end::quiz[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the app
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide documentation settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

== Testing

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire app by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev ops

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
