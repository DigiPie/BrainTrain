== Introduction

BrainTrain is an open-source spaced repetition flashcard application which makes *memorising easy and efficient*. Research has shown that the Spaced-Repetition System (SRS) is *much more effective* than traditional memorization techniques. With BrainTrain, you will *learn more with less time*.

BrainTrain is also a *portable* and *easy-to-navigate* desktop program. It is an *offline* application which you can use anywhere, even in places with limited or no Internet availability. It can be navigated and used via *easy-to-use* commands through the Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI is supplemented by a minimalistic Graphical User Interface (GUI) which provides *helpful but non-distracting visual aid*. Together, the CLI and GUI provides an *effective and straightforward* way for you to use BrainTrain.

Start using BrainTrain today! To get started, read [<<Quick start>>] for installation and setup instructions.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameter values which you need to specify in order for the commands to work. For example,
for `deleteCard INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter you have to specify.
* Parameters with trailing `...` can be specified multiple times. For example, for the `addLesson n/NAME q/QUESTION CORE a/ANSWER CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...` command, you can specify as many `CORE` values as you need to. On the other hand, you can only specify exactly 1 `QUESTION CORE` value.
* Parameters in `[ ]` brackets are optional. For example, for the `addCard c/CORE c/CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...` command, you have to specify at least 2 `CORE` values, but you can optionally specify more than 2 `CORE` values or 0 or more `OPTIONAL` values.
* Parameters can be entered in any order. For example, for `addCard c/CORE c/CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...`, you can use the
command as such `addCard o/Country Code c/Country c/Capital`.

[[start]]
==== Starting a quiz session: `start`

Starts a new quiz session. +
Format: `start n/NAME [c/COUNT] m/MODE`

Usage rules:

* You can optionally specify the `COUNT` parameter. `COUNT` sets the number of cards to be tested in the quiz session. If no `COUNT` is specified, by default 1 card is tested.
* The name field is used to choose lesson.
* You must specify `MODE`. `MODE` sets the testing mode of the quiz session. The three available modes are `LEARN`, `PREVIEW`, `REVIEW` and `DIFFICULT`.
. `LEARN`: Displays new cards with both question and answer shown, before testing begins and only question or answer are shown.
. `PREVIEW`: Displays both question and answer of all flashcards. You will not be tested.
. `REVIEW`: Tests the words based on the spaced-repetition algorithm - flashcards with the earliest test date are tested first.
. `DIFFICULT`: Displays cards you previously labelled as difficult with both question and answer shown. You will not be tested.

[NOTE]
====
Flashcards are tested based on the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition[Space-Repetition technique].
====

Examples:

* `start n/country-capitals m/LEARN` +
Starts a quiz in `LEARN` mode with the 'country-capitals' lesson.
* `start n/country-capitals-asia c/20 m/PREVIEW` +
Starts a quiz containing 20 cards in `PREVIEW` mode with the 'country-capitals-asia' lesson.

[[quizmode]]
=== Quiz mode

When you <<start, `start`>> a quiz, you will enter quiz mode. In this mode, you will only be allowed to enter the following set of quiz commands. Management commands are disabled in this mode.

==== Viewing help: `\help`

Displays usage information on all quiz mode commands and acceptable inputs for answering cards. +
Format: `\help`

==== Viewing the quiz session's status: `\status`

Displays information on the current session's status such as lesson progress (i.e. number of flashcards left). +
Format: `\status`

==== Answering a flashcard : `[ANSWER]`

An input without the `\` prefix will be treated as an answer to the current flashcard. +
Format: `[ANSWER]...`

Usage rules:

* You can answer with one or more words (e.g. "Tokyo" or "Aland Islands").

What a flashcard contains:

* For each flashcard, total attempts and answer streak are tracked.
* Total attempts refers to the number of times you have attempted this flashcard, regardless of
whether you were answered it correctly.
* The answer streak is the number of times you have answered the flashcard correctly consecutively.

[NOTE]
The streak will be reduced to 0 after you answer a flashcard wrongly twice in a row. Hence, if you accidentally enter the wrong answer once, your streak for the question will not be affected, unless you answer wrongly again.

[TIP]
You can press kbd:[ENTER] twice without entering any other input to reveal the answer.

Examples:

* The question is "Japan" and is asking for the capital of "Japan": +
  `Tokyo` +
  This is the correct answer, both the streak and total attempts increased by 1.

* The question is "Tokyo" and is asking for the country of "Tokyo": +
  `Japaan` +
  `Japan` +
  This is the correct answer, the streak increased by 1 while total attempts increased by 2.

* The question is "Tokyo" and is asking for the country of "Tokyo": +
  `Japaan` +
  `Jappan` +
  This is the wrong answer, the streak is reduced to 0 while total attempts increased by 2.

==== Labelling the current flashcard as difficult: `\difficult`
Labels the current flashcard as difficult. +
Format: `\difficult`

Examples:

* The question is "Japan" and is asking for the capital of "Japan": +
  `\difficult` +
  This will label flashcard of "Japan" as difficult.

* The question is "Japan" and is asking for the capital of "Japan": +
  `\difficult` +
  `\difficult` +
  This will label flashcard of "Japan" as not difficult.

[[hint]]

[[usermode]]
=== User Transfer mode

You can use BrainTrain across different devices. This is an in-built feature that is automated in BrainTrain.

==== Using BrainTrain across different devices

To transfer your files: +

. Store the `userdata` and `lessons` folder into your transfer device(thumbdrive etc.).
. On another device, ensure that BrainTrain has been executed `at least once`.
. Transfer and overwrite the `userdata` and `lessons` folder.
. Your progress will be automatically imported on that device.

==== Coming Soon(v2.0)

Easily transfer files using import command to get files directly from a specific link without the use of transfer devices.
Example : import User l/[INSERT_DESIRED_LINK_HERE]

// end::jeraldtsy[]

// TODO
== Troubleshooting

*Q*: Why are my card values shown as `?????`? +
*A*: If your lesson contains non-English characters such as:

* Characters with accents: `à`
* Non-English words : `こんにちは` `السلام عليكم` `你好`

This can be fixed by opening the lesson file in your preferred spreadsheet application (e.g. Excel), and then saving it as `CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (*.csv)`. UTF encoding allows a computer to show non-English characters. +
****
The default encoding setting is unable to process special characters. As a result, you will need to save it as a `UTF-8` encoded file.

Note that externally created lesson files have to be saved with UTF-8 encoding before using them in BrainTrain. +
If the files are saved without `UTF-8` encoding, any non-English data may be saved as `?????`, and the data will be lost.
****

*Q*: Why are my lessons not loading? +
*A*: Please verify if the location of BrainTrain is suitable. Depending on your computer's permissions and security settings, places such as the Desktop may not be usable, and your operating system may prevent BrainTrain from loading the lesson files.

If BrainTrain still does not load lessons despite trying other locations, please contact Team BrainTrain at https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W14-1/main/issues[our issue tracker] or email us at eugenef@u.nus.edu, and attach any generated braintrain.log files.
