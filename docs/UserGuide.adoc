== Introduction

BrainTrain is an open-source spaced repetition flashcard application which makes *memorizing easy and efficient*. Research has shown that the Spaced-Repetition System (SRS) is *much more effective* than traditional memorization techniques. With BrainTrain, you will *learn more with less time*.

BrainTrain is also a *portable* and *easy-to-navigate* desktop program. It is an *offline* application which you can use anywhere, even in places with limited or no Internet availability. It can be navigated and used via *easy-to-use* commands through the Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI is supplemented by a minimalistic Graphical User Interface (GUI) which provides *helpful but non-distracting visual aid*. Together, the CLI and GUI provides an *effective and straightforward* way for you to use BrainTrain.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameter values which you need to specify in order for the commands to work. For example,
for `deleteCard INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter you have to specify. Typing `deleteCard 1` will inform the application
that you intend to delete the lesson at index 1.
* Parameters with trailing `...` can be specified as many times as you want. For example, for
`addLesson n/NAME q/QUESTION CORE a/ANSWER CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...`, you can only specify as many `CORE`
values as you need to. On the other hand, you can only specify exactly 1 `QUESTION CORE` value.
* Parameters in `[ ]` brackets are optional. For example, for `addCard c/CORE c/CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...`,
it is necessary to specify at least 2 `CORE` values, but you can optionally specify more `CORE` values. Additionally,
`OPTIONAL` values are completely optional and you can specify either 0 or as many `OPTIONAL` values as you need to.
* Parameters can be in any order. For example, for `addCard c/CORE c/CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...`, you can use the
command as such `addCard o/Country Code c/Country c/Capital`.

[[start]]
==== Starting quiz session: `start`

Switches to Quiz Mode and starts a new quiz session. +

[NOTE]
====
Flashcards are tested based on the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition[Space-Repetition technique].
====
Format: `start n/NAME [c/COUNT] m/MODE`

Usage rules:

* The count field is optional. It represents the number of cards the user wants in the session. By default, it sets to be 10.
* The number of cards should be at least 1. The start command will fail with count to be 0.
* The mode field only supports three mode: `learn, preview and review`.

Examples:

* `start n/02-03-LEARN c/15 m/LEARN`

[[listLessons]]
==== Listing all lessons: `listLessons`

Displays a numbered list of all lessons. +
Format: `listLessons`

==== Adding a lesson: `addLesson`
Adds a lesson. +
Format: `addLesson n/NAME q/QUESTION CORE a/ANSWER CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...`

Usage rules:

* The lesson must contain a name.
* The lesson must contain a `QUESTION CORE` and `ANSWER CORE`. The `QUESTION CORE` and `ANSWER CORE` are `CORE` headers which describe the question and answer `CORE` values of flashcards added to this lesson.
** For example, a lesson for memorising capitals of countries would have the `QUESTION CORE` set as "Country" and `ANSWER_CORE` set as "Capital".
* The lesson can have additional `CORE` headers which can be set as the `QUESTION CORE` and `ANSWER CORE` when necessary.
** Following the previous example, an additional `CORE` header could be "Language", so that you could use the same lesson for memorising languages of countries.
* Flash cards added to the lesson must have corresponding `QUESTION CORE`, `ANSWER CORE` and `CORE` values.
* The lesson can optionally have `OPTIONAL` values. A possible `OPTIONAL` value could be "Hint".
* Flash cards added to the lesson need not have corresponding `OPTIONAL` values.

[TIP]
`OPTIONAL` values are displayed during quiz mode when you enter <<hint, `\hint`>>.

Examples:

* `addLesson n/Upper limb anatomy q/Statement a/TrueOrFalse`
* `addLesson n/Capitals of the world q/Country a/Capital c/Language o/Hint`

  `Tokyo` +
  This is the correct answer, both the streak and total attempts increased by 1.

  `Japaan` +
  `Japan` +
  This is the correct answer, the streak increased by 1 while total attempts increased by 2.

== Troubleshooting

*Q*: Why are my card values shown as `?????` or question marks? +
*A*: If your lesson contains non-ASCII characters such as:

* Characters with accents: `à`
* Non-English words : `こんにちは` `السلام عليكم` `你好`

This can be fixed in Excel by going into the Save As dialog, and saving as `CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (*.csv)`. For other csv file editors, you may need to look up relevant documentation on how save in UTF-8 encoding. +
****
The default encoding setting is unable to process special characters. As a result, you will need to save it as a UTF-8 encoded csv file.

Note that the files have to be saved as a UTF-8 encoded csv file before the first save. +
If the file is saved without UTF-8 encoding, the data may have already been saved as ?????, and all non-ASCII characters are lost.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
