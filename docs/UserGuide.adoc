== Introduction
// tag::evan-intro[]
BrainTrain is a *spaced-repetition flashcard application* which makes *memorizing easy and effective*. With BrainTrain's link:https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/23/spaced-repetition-a-hack-to-make-your-brain-store-information[Spaced Repetition System (SRS)] optimizing your flashcard revision intervals, you will be able to *learn more in less time*.

*Who is it for:*

- Anyone who needs to memorise anything should use BrainTrain (e.g. Japanese vocabulary, periodic table, human anatomy). BrainTrain's flashcard system is *content-agnostic* and *flexible*. It accommodates all forms of learning you may require.
- Anyone who needs to create flashcard learning content for educational purposes should use BrainTrain. BrainTrain's flashcards are grouped as lessons which can be *easily imported and exported*. These lessons are also saved in `.csv` files which you *can edit in your favourite spreadsheet application* (e.g. Excel).

*Main features of BrainTrain:*

- You can manage flashcard lessons in BrainTrain's management mode or alternatively do so in your preferred spreadsheet application.
- You can attempt flashcard lessons in BrainTrain's quiz mode which will track and manage your user-specific spaced-repetition data automatically.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameter values which you need to specify in order for the commands to work. For example,
for `deleteCard INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter you have to specify.
* Parameters with trailing `...` can be specified multiple times. For example, for the `addLesson n/NAME q/QUESTION CORE a/ANSWER CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...` command, you can specify as many `CORE` values as you need to. On the other hand, you can only specify exactly 1 `QUESTION CORE` value.
* Parameters in `[ ]` brackets are optional. For example, for the `addCard c/CORE c/CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...` command, you have to specify at least 2 `CORE` values, but you can optionally specify more than 2 `CORE` values or 0 or more `OPTIONAL` values.
* Parameters can be entered in any order. For example, for `addCard c/CORE c/CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...`, you can use the
command as such `addCard o/Country Code c/Country c/Capital`.

[[help]]
==== Viewing help: `help`

Displays usage information on all commands. +
Format: `help`

[TIP]
Alternatively, press kbd:[F1] to display usage information on all commands.

[[start]]
==== Starting a quiz session: `start`

Starts a new quiz session. +
Format: `start n/NAME [c/COUNT] m/MODE`

Usage rules:

* You can optionally specify the `COUNT` parameter. `COUNT` sets the number of cards to be tested in the quiz session. If no `COUNT` is specified, by default 1 card is tested.
* The name field is used to choose lesson.
* You must specify `MODE`. `MODE` sets the testing mode of the quiz session. The three available modes are `LEARN`, `PREVIEW`, `REVIEW` and `DIFFICULT`.
. `LEARN`: Displays new cards with both question and answer shown, before testing begins and only question or answer are shown.
. `PREVIEW`: Displays both question and answer of all flashcards. You will not be tested.
. `REVIEW`: Tests the words based on the spaced-repetition algorithm - flashcards with the earliest test date are tested first.
. `DIFFICULT`: Displays cards you previously labelled as difficult with both question and answer shown. You will not be tested.

[NOTE]
====
Flashcards are tested based on the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition[Space-Repetition technique].
====

Examples:

* `start n/country-capitals m/LEARN` +
Starts a quiz in `LEARN` mode with the 'country-capitals' lesson.
* `start n/country-capitals-asia c/20 m/PREVIEW` +
Starts a quiz containing 20 cards in `PREVIEW` mode with the 'country-capitals-asia' lesson.

[NOTE]

Format: `addLesson n/NAME q/QUESTION CORE a/ANSWER CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...`

Usage rules:

* You must specify `QUESTION CORE` and `ANSWER CORE`. `QUESTION CORE` and `ANSWER CORE` sets the `CORE` headers describing the question and answer `CORE` values of flashcards added to this lesson.
** For example, a lesson for memorising the capitals of countries will have the `QUESTION CORE` set as "Country" and `ANSWER_CORE` set as "Capital".
* You can optionally specify 0 or more additional `CORE` headers (e.g. "Language"), which can be set as the `QUESTION CORE` and `ANSWER CORE` by using the command `editLesson`.
* You can only add flashcards which have `QUESTION CORE`, `ANSWER CORE` and `CORE` values which correspond to the lesson's `CORE` headers.
* You can optionally specify 0 or more `OPTIONAL` values (e.g. "Hint").
** Flash cards added to the lesson *need not* have corresponding `OPTIONAL` values.
** `OPTIONAL` values are displayed during quiz mode when you enter <<hint, `\hint`>>.

Examples:

* `addLesson n/Upper limb anatomy q/Statement a/TrueOrFalse`
* `addLesson n/Capitals of the world q/Country a/Capital c/Language o/Hint`

[[quizmode]]
=== Quiz mode

When you <<start, `start`>> a quiz, you will enter quiz mode. In this mode, you will only be allowed to enter the following set of quiz commands. Management commands are disabled in this mode.

==== Viewing help: `\help`

Displays usage information on all quiz mode commands and acceptable inputs for answering cards. +
Format: `\help`

==== Viewing the quiz session's status: `\status`

Displays information on the current session's status such as lesson progress (i.e. number of flashcards left). +
Format: `\status`

==== Answering a flashcard : `[ANSWER]`

An input without the `\` prefix will be treated as an answer to the current flashcard. +
Format: `[ANSWER]...`

Usage rules:

* You can answer with one or more words (e.g. "Tokyo" or "Aland Islands").

What a flashcard contains:

* For each flashcard, total attempts and answer streak are tracked.
* Total attempts refers to the number of times you have attempted this flashcard, regardless of
whether you were answered it correctly.
* The answer streak is the number of times you have answered the flashcard correctly consecutively.

[NOTE]
The streak will be reduced to 0 after you answer a flashcard wrongly twice in a row. Hence, if you accidentally enter the wrong answer once, your streak for the question will not be affected, unless you answer wrongly again.

[TIP]
You can press kbd:[ENTER] twice without entering any other input to reveal the answer.

Examples:

* The question is "Japan" and is asking for the capital of "Japan": +
  `Tokyo` +
  This is the correct answer, both the streak and total attempts increased by 1.

* The question is "Tokyo" and is asking for the country of "Tokyo": +
  `Japaan` +
  `Japan` +
  This is the correct answer, the streak increased by 1 while total attempts increased by 2.

* The question is "Tokyo" and is asking for the country of "Tokyo": +
  `Japaan` +
  `Jappan` +
  This is the wrong answer, the streak is reduced to 0 while total attempts increased by 2.

==== Labelling the current flashcard as difficult: `\difficult`
Labels the current flashcard as difficult. +
Format: `\difficult`

Examples:

* The question is "Japan" and is asking for the capital of "Japan": +
  `\difficult` +
  This will label flashcard of "Japan" as difficult.

* The question is "Japan" and is asking for the capital of "Japan": +
  `\difficult` +
  `\difficult` +
  This will label flashcard of "Japan" as not difficult.

[[hint]]

=== User Transfer mode

You can use BrainTrain across different devices. This is an in-built feature that is automated in BrainTrain.

==== Using BrainTrain across different devices

To transfer your files: +

. Store the `userdata` and `lessons` folder into your transfer device(thumbdrive etc.).
. On another device, ensure that BrainTrain has been executed `at least once`.
. Transfer and overwrite the `userdata` and `lessons` folder.
. Your progress will be automatically imported on that device.

==== Coming Soon(v2.0)

Easily transfer files using import command to get files directly from a specific link without the use of transfer devices.
Example : import User l/[INSERT_DESIRED_LINK_HERE]

// end::jeraldtsy[]

// TODO
== Troubleshooting

*Q*: Why are my card values shown as `?????`? +
*A*: If your lesson contains non-ASCII characters such as:

* Characters with accents: `à`
* Non-English words : `こんにちは` `السلام عليكم` `你好`

This can be fixed by opening the lesson file in your preferred spreadsheet application (e.g. Excel), and then saving it as `CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (*.csv)`. +
****
The default encoding setting is unable to process special characters. As a result, you will need to save it as a `UTF-8` encoded `.csv` file.

Note that the lesson files have to be saved as a `UTF-8` encoded `.csv` file before the first save. +
If the file is saved without `UTF-8` encoding, the data may be saved as `?????`, and all non-ASCII characters will be discarded.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and transfer the lesson `.csv` files over to the `/data` directory.
