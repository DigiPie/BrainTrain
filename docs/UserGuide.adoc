== Introduction

BrainTrain is an open-source spaced repetition flashcard application which makes *memorizing easy and efficient*. Research has shown that the Spaced-Repetition System (SRS) is *much more effective* than traditional memorization techniques. With BrainTrain, you will *learn more with less time*.

BrainTrain is also a *portable* and *easy-to-navigate* desktop program. It is an *offline* application which you can use anywhere, even in places with limited or no Internet availability. It can be navigated and used via *easy-to-use* commands through the Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI is supplemented by a minimalistic Graphical User Interface (GUI) which provides *helpful but non-distracting visual aid*. Together, the CLI and GUI provides an *effective and straightforward* way for you to use BrainTrain.

Start using BrainTrain today! To get started, read [<<Quick start>>] for installation and setup instructions.

== Quick start
To begin using BrainTrain, follow the following set of instructions: +

. Ensure that Java version `9` or later is installed on your Computer. You can download it link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase9-3934878.html[here].
. Download the latest `braintrain.jar` file link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Create a folder to use as the home folder for BrainTrain (e.g. `braintrain/`).
. Move the downloaded file to the created folder.
. You can **optionally** download a sample lesson here: link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W14-1/main/blob/master/src/test/data/country-capitals-asia.csv[`country-capitals-asia.csv`]. +
Put the sample lesson into a `data` sub-folder within the `braintrain` folder (i.e. `braintrain/data/`).
. Double-click the file to run BrainTrain. The GUI will appear in a few seconds.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameter values which you need to specify in order for the commands to work. For example,
for `deleteCard INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter you have to specify.
* Parameters with trailing `...` can be specified multiple times. For example, for the `addLesson n/NAME q/QUESTION CORE a/ANSWER CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...` command, you can specify as many `CORE` values as you need to. On the other hand, you can only specify exactly 1 `QUESTION CORE` value.
* Parameters in `[ ]` brackets are optional. For example, for the `addCard c/CORE c/CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...` command, you have to specify at least 2 `CORE` values, but you can optionally specify more than 2 `CORE` values or 0 or more `OPTIONAL` values.
* Parameters can be entered in any order. For example, for `addCard c/CORE c/CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...`, you can use the
command as such `addCard o/Country Code c/Country c/Capital`.

=== Management mode

[[help]]
==== Viewing help: `help`

Displays usage information on all commands. +
Format: `help`

[TIP]
Alternatively, press kbd:[F1] to display usage information on all commands.

==== Changing theme: `changeTheme`

Changes the theme from light to dark vice versa. +
Format: `changeTheme`

[[start]]
==== Starting a quiz session: `start`

Starts a new quiz session. +
Format: `start n/NAME [c/COUNT] m/MODE`

Usage rules:

* You can optionally specify the `COUNT` parameter. `COUNT` sets the number of cards to be tested in the quiz session. If no `COUNT` is specified, by default 1 card is tested.
* The name field is used to choose lesson.
* You must specify `MODE`. `MODE` sets the testing mode of the quiz session. The three available modes are `LEARN`, `PREVIEW`, `REVIEW` and `DIFFICULT`.
. `LEARN`: Displays new cards with both question and answer shown, before testing begins and only question or answer are shown.
. `PREVIEW`: Displays both question and answer of all flashcards. You will not be tested.
. `REVIEW`: Tests the words based on the spaced-repetition algorithm - flashcards with the earliest test date are tested first.
. `DIFFICULT`: Displays cards you previously labelled as difficult with both question and answer shown. You will not be tested.

[NOTE]
====
Flashcards are tested based on the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition[Space-Repetition technique].
====

Examples:

* `start n/country-capitals m/LEARN` +
Starts a quiz in `LEARN` mode with the 'country-capitals' lesson.
* `start n/country-capitals-asia c/20 m/PREVIEW` +
Starts a quiz containing 20 cards in `PREVIEW` mode with the 'country-capitals-asia' lesson.

[NOTE]
====
After you start a quiz session with the `start` command, BrainTrain will switch to <<quizmode, `quiz
mode`>> and you will only be allowed to enter <<quizmode, `quiz mode`>> commands.

Adds a lesson. +
Format: `addLesson n/NAME q/QUESTION CORE a/ANSWER CORE [c/CORE]... [o/OPTIONAL]...`

Usage rules:

* You must specify `QUESTION CORE` and `ANSWER CORE`. `QUESTION CORE` and `ANSWER CORE` sets the `CORE` headers describing the question and answer `CORE` values of flashcards added to this lesson.
** For example, a lesson for memorising the capitals of countries will have the `QUESTION CORE` set as "Country" and `ANSWER_CORE` set as "Capital".
* You can optionally specify 0 or more additional `CORE` headers (e.g. "Language"), which can be set as the `QUESTION CORE` and `ANSWER CORE` by using the command `editLesson`.
* You can only add flashcards which have `QUESTION CORE`, `ANSWER CORE` and `CORE` values which correspond to the lesson's `CORE` headers.
* You can optionally specify 0 or more `OPTIONAL` values (e.g. "Hint").
** Flash cards added to the lesson *need not* have corresponding `OPTIONAL` values.
** `OPTIONAL` values are displayed during quiz mode when you enter <<hint, `\hint`>>.

[[quizmode]]
=== Quiz mode

When you <<start, `start`>> a quiz, you will enter quiz mode. In this mode, you will only be allowed to enter the following set of quiz commands. Management commands are disabled in this mode.

==== Answering a card : `[ANSWER]`

An input without the `\` prefix will be treated as an answer to the current card. +
Format: `[ANSWER]...`

****
Usage rules:

* You can answer with one or more words (e.g. "Tokyo" or "Aland Islands").

What a card contains:

* For each card, total attempts and answer streak are tracked.
* Total attempts refers to the number of times you have attempted this card, regardless of
whether you were answered it correctly.
* The answer streak is the number of times you have answered the card correctly consecutively.
****

[NOTE]
The streak will be reduced to 0 after you answer a card wrongly twice in a row. Hence, if you
accidentally enter the wrong answer once, your streak for the question will not be affected, unless you answer wrongly again.

[TIP]
You can press kbd:[ENTER] twice without entering any other input to reveal the answer.

// TODO
== Troubleshooting

*Q*: Why are my card values shown as `?????`? +
*A*: If your lesson contains non-ASCII characters such as:

* Characters with accents: `à`
* Non-English words : `こんにちは` `السلام عليكم` `你好`

This can be fixed by opening the lesson file in your preferred spreadsheet application (e.g. Excel), and then saving it as `CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (*.csv)`. +
****
The default encoding setting is unable to process special characters. As a result, you will need to save it as a `UTF-8` encoded `.csv` file.

Note that the lesson files have to be saved as a `UTF-8` encoded `.csv` file before the first save. +
If the file is saved without `UTF-8` encoding, the data may be saved as `?????`, and all non-ASCII characters will be discarded.

== FAQ
