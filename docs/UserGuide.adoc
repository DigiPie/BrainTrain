== Introduction

BrainTrain is an open-source spaced repetition flashcard application which makes *memorizing easy and efficient*. Research has shown that the Spaced-Repetition System (SRS) is *much more effective* than traditional memorization techniques. With BrainTrain, you will *learn more with less time*.

BrainTrain is also a *portable* and *easy-to-navigate* desktop program. It is an *offline* application which you can use anywhere, even in places with limited or no Internet availability. It can be navigated and used via *easy-to-use* commands through the Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI is supplemented by a minimalistic Graphical User Interface (GUI) which provides *helpful but non-distracting visual aid*. Together, the CLI and GUI provides an *effective and straightforward* way for you to use BrainTrain.

== Troubleshooting

*Q*: Why are my card values shown as `?????` or question marks? +
*A*: If your lesson contains non-ASCII characters such as:

* Characters with accents: `à`
* Non-English words : `こんにちは` `السلام عليكم` `你好`

This can be fixed in Excel by going into the Save As dialog, and saving as `CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (*.csv)`. For other csv file editors, you may need to look up relevant documentation on how save in UTF-8 encoding. +
****
The default encoding setting is unable to process special characters. As a result, you will need to save it as a UTF-8 encoded csv file.

Note that the files have to be saved as a UTF-8 encoded csv file before the first save. +
If the file is saved without UTF-8 encoding, the data may have already been saved as ?????, and all non-ASCII characters are lost.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
