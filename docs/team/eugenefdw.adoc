== Introduction

This project portfolio highlights my various contributions to the BrainTrain project, including code, documentation and administrative matters.

=== Overview of project requirements
BrainTrain was developed as part of the CS2103T Software Engineering module at the National University of Singapore. My team of 5 were given seven weeks to develop our application, built off of https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[an existing address book application].

We were expected to apply industry-standard practices and tools such as Github and Continuous Integration. Beyond the application, we were also required to document our work in a User Guide and Developer Guide.

=== Overview of BrainTrain

BrainTrain is a memorisation tool made for students and other learners, especially in content-heavy subjects, such as language vocabulary, science terminology and others.

BrainTrain is a flashcard application that implements a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition[Spaced Repetition System] (SRS) to test the user over time. This allows you to remember various things in a short amount of time, yet also assist in memorization long-term as you continuously use the application.

== Summary of contributions

My role was to design and manage the storage of Lesson data in BrainTrain. The following sections will highlight some of the choices I made and the reasons behind them, and various other contributions to the administration and documentation of the project.

=== *Major enhancement*
Added the ability to save and load Lesson data to Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files

** What it does: Allows the user to save and load flashcard lesson data to CSV files, which are easy to edit in a spreadsheet format.
** Justification: `*TODO FROM HERE ONWARDS*` This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#search=eugenefdw[RepoSense]]

==== Reloading all lessons: `reloadLessons`
Reloads all lessons from the lessons folder. The default folder is `/lessons/`, found next to `braintrain.jar`.

Format: `reloadLessons`

Steps:

. You have a newly downloaded .csv lesson file, `new_lesson.csv`, with no lessons currently loaded.
+
.A new lesson file.

==== Troubleshooting

{empty} +

*Q*: Why are my card values shown as `?????`? +
*A*: If your lesson contains non-English characters such as:

* Characters with accents: `à`
* Non-English words : `こんにちは` `السلام عليكم` `你好`

This can be fixed by opening the lesson file in your preferred spreadsheet application (e.g. Excel), and then saving it as `CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (*.csv)`. UTF encoding allows a computer to show non-English characters. +
****
The default encoding setting is unable to process special characters. As a result, you will need to save it as a `UTF-8` encoded file.

Note that externally created lesson files have to be saved with UTF-8 encoding before using them in BrainTrain. +
If the files are saved without `UTF-8` encoding, any non-English data may be saved as `?????`, and the data will be lost.
****

---

*Q*: Why are my lessons not loading? +
*A*: Please verify if the location of BrainTrain is suitable. Depending on your computer's permissions and security settings, places such as the Desktop may not be usable, and your operating system may prevent BrainTrain from loading the lesson files.

If BrainTrain still does not load lessons despite trying other locations, please contact Team BrainTrain at https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W14-1/main/issues[our issue tracker] or email us at eugenef@u.nus.edu, and attach any generated braintrain.log files.
