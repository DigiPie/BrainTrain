== Overview of BrainTrain

BrainTrain is a memorisation tool made for students and other learners, especially in content-heavy subjects. BrainTrain is a flashcard application that implements a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) to test the user over time. This allows you to remember various things in a shorter amount of time, yet also ensuring that you remember it long-term as you use the application.

BrainTrain was built on top of an existing command line based address book application, as part of a software engineering project.

My role was to design and manage the storage of Lesson data in BrainTrain. The following sections will highlight some of the choices I made and the reasons behind them, and various other contributions to the administration and documentation of the project.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability to *save and load Lesson data to Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files*
** What it does: Allows the user to save and load flashcard lesson data to CSV files, which are easy to edit in a spreadsheet format.
** Justification: `*TODO FROM HERE ONWARDS*` This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#search=eugenefdw[RepoSense]][https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_
