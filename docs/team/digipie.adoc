== Introduction +
The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my software engineering competency by showcasing my code and documentation contributions to the link:{repoURL}[BrainTrain project].

=== Overview +
The BrainTrain project was developed by a team of 5 students over seven weeks, under the National University of Singapore's link:{seeduURL}[CS2103T: Software Engineering module]. +

CS2103T students were given the option of enhancing an link:{seeduURL}[existing addressbook application] or morphing it into another product. We chose to morph it into a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition[spaced-repetition] flashcard application because we wanted to further challenge ourselves and improve our software engineering skills.

=== What is BrainTrain +

BrainTrain is a flashcard application which makes *memorizing easy and efficient*. link:https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/23/spaced-repetition-a-hack-to-make-your-brain-store-information[Research] has shown that the Spaced-Repetition System (SRS) is much more effective than traditional memorization techniques. With BrainTrain, you will *learn more with less time*.

Who is it for:

- Learners who need to memorise content (e.g. Japanese vocabulary, human anatomy, operating system concepts)
- Educators who want to create flashcard lessons for their students

Main features of BrainTrain:

- You can add, edit and delete flashcard lessons in BrainTrain's management mode.
- You can also create lessons in your preferred spreadsheet application and import them as `.csv` files with ease.
- You can attempt flashcard lessons in BrainTrain's quiz mode and your user-specific data (e.g. spaced-repetition information) will be saved automatically.

== Summary of contributions +
My primary responsibility was to design, develop and test the Card Management System. My secondary responsibility was to act as the project's documentation lead. The following is a list of my key contributions to the project.

=== Major enhancement +
My largest contribution to the project was the implementation of the Card Management System (CMS): +

* Context: In BrainTrain, each lesson contains a set of flashcards of the same type and topic.
* What it does: CMS provides users with the ability to add, edit and delete lessons in *Lesson View* and *Card View* modes.
* In *Lesson View*, users can:
** Add and delete lessons by using the `addLesson` and `deleteLesson` commands.
** Open a lesson in *Card View* for editing by using the `edit` command.
** List the full details of all lessons by using the `listLessons` command.
* In *Card View*, users can:
** Add and delete flashcards by using the `addCard` and `deleteCard` commands.
** Set the 2 test values to be tested in quiz mode for all flashcards in the lesson by using the `set` command.
** Quit *Card View* and return to *Lesson View* by using the `quit` command.
** List the full details of all cards by using the `listCards` command.
* Justification: Users need to be able to create and edit content in order to use BrainTrain for flashcard learning.
* Most significant pull requests: link:{pullURL}113[#113], link:{pullURL}173[#173] and link:{pullURL}180[#180]
* Code contributed: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=digipie[View on RepoSense] +

=== Minor enhancement +
My second largest contribution to the project was the implementation of the Graphical User Interface representation for the Card Management System: +

* What it does: Displays all lessons as a list in *Lesson View*, and also displays a lesson's details and its flashcards in *Card View*.
* Justification: Users are able to view all lessons and their flashcards easily.
* In *Lesson View*, users can view all lessons and their details (e.g. number of cards):

.*Lesson View*

* In *Card View*, users can view the opened lesson's details and its flashcards:

=== Other contributions +
In addition to designing and writing code, I also contributed to the project through the following means:

* Documentation:
As the documentation lead, I ensured overall consistency and coherency for the project's user guide and developer guide by,
** Writing the User Guide's Introduction and Quick Start sections (see link:{pullURL}15[#15], link:{pullURL}85[#85],  link:{pullURL}113[#113] and link:{pullURL}180[#180])
** Editing the User Guide and Developer Guide for overall coherency as editor (see
link:{pullURL}20[#20], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-link:{pullURL}85[#85], link:{pullURL}107[#107] and link:{pullURL}180[#180])
* Project management: I assisted the team lead in managing 2 product releases and milestone `v1.3` by,
** Managing product releases `v1.2.1` and `v1.3.0`
** Coordinating team for milestone `v1.3`
* Software architecture: I improved existing code to improve overall project quality and team workflow by,
** Implementing major refactor of `seedu.address.logic` package structure and design to improve workflow for entire team (see  link:{pullURL}/85[#85])
** Performing major overhaul of `seedu.address.model.util` package to improve modularity and extensibility of sample data generation (see link:{pullURL}/180[#180])
* Community: I worked with my team to resolve problems and achieve greater code quality by,
** Assisting teammates in fixing their bugs (see link:{pullURL}33[#33] and link:{pullURL}97[#97])
** Reviewing teammates' pull requests with non-trivial, constructive feedback (see link:{pullURL}37[#37], link:{pullURL}108[#108], link:{pullURL}132[#132], link:{pullURL}133[#133], link:{pullURL}139[#139] and link:{pullURL}175[#175])

== Contributions to the User Guide +
In addition to updating the User Guide with the newly added Card Management System commands, I also wrote the Introduction and Quick Start sections, and edited the document to ensure overall consistency. I have listed some of my key contributions to the document as excerpts below:

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=evan]

== Contributions to the Developer Guide +
On top of updating the Developer Guide with the Card Management System design and implementation details, I also edited the document to ensure overall consistency. I have listed some of my key contributions to the document as excerpts below:

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=evan]
