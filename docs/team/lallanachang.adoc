== PROJECT: BrainTrain

This project portfolio page displays my contributions to the BrainTrain project.

== Overview

BrainTrain is an open-source spaced repetition flashcard application for people who need to memorise something which is content heavy. Research has shown that the Spaced-Repetition System (SRS) is much more effective than traditional memorization techniques since it help users review more their poorly memorised words. With BrainTrain, you will learn more with less time since this application makes memorizing an easier and more efficient job.

BrainTrain is also a portable and easy-to-navigate desktop program. It is an offline application which you can use anywhere, even in places with limited or no Internet availability. It can be navigated and used via easy-to-use commands through the Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI is supplemented by a minimalistic Graphical User Interface (GUI) which provides helpful but non-distracting visual aid. Together, the CLI and GUI provides an effective and straightforward way for you to use BrainTrain.
